## CIS343 - Practice LISP Functions (Project 7)
This project was created by Ummayair Ahmad and Kyle Jacobson for Structures of Programming Languages (CIS 343) during the Winter 2021 semester at Grand Valley State University.

This project was programmed using the LISP programming language on Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.

It is a collection of practice LISP functions that will help us interact with and understand this programming language.
